# 10. Benefit Analysis

Echoing the original purpose of this experiment, that is to reduce the time of production line personnel on inspection, or even cancel this step to <mark style="background-color:red;">improve units Per Hour Per Person</mark>(UPPH).

The following will start the analysis for UPH.

<mark style="background-color:red;">Before</mark> the machine learning process is introduced into the production line:

<mark style="background-color:red;">After</mark> the machine learning process is introduced into the production line:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

Therefore, this difference can be used for benefit forecasting. Here we will analyze T1 as the target

* Save 0.025 USD/unit
* Save 2,097 USD/week
* Save 8,388 USD/month
* <mark style="background-color:red;">**Save 109,044 USD/year**</mark>

Of course, we still need to consider more details of the construction of this system. This cost includes the consumption of&#x20;

* components
* personnel investment
* the cost of importing the original system
* the cost of more research time
* the cost of subsequent returns caused by wrong predictions

However, we can be sure that if the system is successfully set up, it will bring <mark style="background-color:red;">long-term benefits</mark>, and because the model is sufficiently expandable, if the model according to the size is successfully imported, it will be able to quickly replicate the successful model and create new model for quality prediction system.
