# 6. Data Preprocessing

### <mark style="color:red;">Notice!</mark>

The <mark style="background-color:red;">data preprocessing phase</mark> and <mark style="background-color:red;">model training phase</mark> would need to repeat 15 times, because the number of false data is still too small.

However, if there are more false data, then it could be do once only .

### 6.1 Input data

In this phase, we'll modify and split raw data.

### 6.2 Install the library

The best way to interact with our API is to use one of our official libraries:

```python
import sys
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from csv import writer
from numpy import where
from csv import DictReader
from matplotlib import pyplot
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Save Model Using joblib
import numpy as np
import joblib
```

### 6.3 Split Data

In order to create training data set and test set, we need to split the raw data.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
dataset = pd.read_csv('C:/BrianChou/predictionModel.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Where the CSV file has been sorted as a cleaner form as follow,

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

### 6.4 Split data into four groups

```python
// 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)
```

### 6.5 Transform data into Standard Scale

```python
// Some code
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
```

### 6.6 Store the scaler, and it could be used later

```python
joblib.dump(sc, 'C:/Users/choubrianty/Downloads/Ensemble/batch_15/std_scaler.bin', compress=True)
```
